## SDK-Implementation (Demo).

A Simple demo that simulates how things communicate to each other in `SDK`.

## Install Dependencies

First, in the root run the command:

```bash
npm i // To install NextJs & Mobx Dependencies.
```

Then go to the directory `json-server`, and run the command:

```bash
npm i // To install Json-Server (local server for demo purposes).
```

## Getting Started

First, go to `json-server` directory and run the local server:

```bash
npm run start
```

this will run the sever on port `4000`.
You can open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) with your browser to see the `api's`.

Then in root run the command

```bash
npm run dev
```

this will start development sever on port `3000`.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
